# Ham or Spam

This dojo is a chance to introduce the Bayes Theorom and an application of the [Naive Bayes Classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier) to determine whether a given SMS message is Ham, or Spam.

The training an validation sets in this project were taken from [This F# ham or spam dojo](https://github.com/c4fsharp/Dojo-Ham-Or-Spam/blob/master/Dojo/HamOrSpam/).

Additionally, should you get stuck and understand F# I would recommend perusing the [F# version](https://github.com/c4fsharp/Dojo-Ham-Or-Spam/blob/master/Dojo/HamOrSpam/Tutorial.fsx).
